SlightX is a free operating system developped in C and Assembly for x86 architectures.
This OS is conform to the POSIX conventions. SlightX is based on a microkernel architecture.

- boot/ : This folder contains GRUB's config file menu.lst
- kernel/ : Kernel's source
- libc/ : The library to develop on SlightX
- doc/ : Documentation I used to write SlightX, and Doxygen documentation
- apps/ : Applications for SlightX
- bin/ : Every binary files

SlightX is based on the James Molloy's tutorial : http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html

To test SlightX :
$ make all install run # It will compile, install on disk.img and run into QEMU
Generate documentation :
$ make doc # It will run doxygen
$ $(my favorite web browser) doc/doxygen/html/index.html
